# NAME

Test::mysqld - mysqld runner for tests

# SYNOPSIS

```perl
use DBI;
use Test::mysqld;
use Test::More;

my $mysqld = Test::mysqld->new(
  my_cnf => {
    'skip-networking' => '', # no TCP socket
  }
) or plan skip_all => $Test::mysqld::errstr;

plan tests => XXX;

my $dbh = DBI->connect(
  $mysqld->dsn(dbname => 'test'),
);

# start_mysqlds is faster than calling Test::mysqld->new twice
my @mysqlds = Test::mysqld->start_mysqlds(
  2,
  my_cnf => {
    'skip-networking' => '', # no TCP socket
  }
) or plan skip_all => $Test::mysqld::errstr;
Test::mysqlds->stop_mysqlds(@mysqlds);
```

# DESCRIPTION

`Test::mysqld` automatically setups a mysqld instance in a temporary directory, and destroys it when the perl script exits.

# FUNCTIONS

## new

Create and run a mysqld instance.  The instance is terminated when the returned object is being DESTROYed.  If required programs (mysql\_install\_db and mysqld) were not found, the function returns undef and sets appropriate message to $Test::mysqld::errstr.

## base\_dir

Returns directory under which the mysqld instance is being created.  The property can be set as a parameter of the `new` function, in which case the directory will not be removed at exit.

## copy\_data\_from

If specified, uses a copy of the specified directory as the data directory of MySQL.  "Mysql" database (which is used to store administrative information) is automatically created if necessary by invoking mysql\_install\_db.

## my\_cnf

A hash containing the list of name=value pairs to be written into my.cnf.  The property can be set as a parameter of the `new` function.

## mysql\_install\_db

## mysqld

Path to `mysql_install_db` script or `mysqld` program bundled to the mysqld distribution.  If not set, the program is automatically search by looking up $PATH and other prefixed directories.

## dsn

Builds and returns dsn by using given parameters (if any).  Default username depends on a server version and a socket family.  Default dbname is 'test'.

## pid

Returns process id of mysqld (or undef if not running).

## start

Starts mysqld.

## stop

Stops mysqld.

## setup

Setups the mysqld instance.

## read\_log

Returns the contents of the mysqld log file.

## start\_mysqlds

Create and run some mysqld instances, and return a list of `Test::mysqld`.

## stop\_mysqlds

Stop some mysqld instances.
